## Game Logic

The classic ***Rock, Paper, Scissors*** game is usually a two player hand game where the players form a *fist* to imitate  *rock*, a *flat hand*  as *paper* and a *fist with outstretched index and middle finger forming a "V"* as *scissors*.

The game is one on the following logic:

***Paper* beats *Rock*, *Rock* beats *Scissors* and *Scissors* beats *Rock*.**
